## Hi, I'm Scarlett 👋

I am a current undergraduate at Washington University in St. Louis studying Computer Science with focus in cybersecurity and a minor in Asian American Studies. I became interested in computer science in middle school when I taught myself JavaScript. I am looking for an internship in software engineering or cyber. 

While I am not coding, I love to rock climb 🧗‍♀️, run 🏃‍♀️, and be outside in nature 
🏞. I also have a small business on Etsy, you can find it [@ScarlettpAndCo](https://www.etsy.com/shop/ScarlettpAndCo). 

## Current Project 💻

Tech stack: Next.js, MongoDB, Vercel
